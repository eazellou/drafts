# Adding Afternoon Dances on 4th Sundays
In 2025, we will add afternoon contra dances on most 4th Sundays. We're excited about this idea for a few reasons:
- more dancing!
- dancers who can't attend sunday evening dances might be able to join us in the afternoon
- we'll be able to book more callers and musicians
- ending earlier opens up opportunities for post-dance social events
## Schedule
We will keep the length of the beginner lesson and the dance the same as our evening dances, just shifted earlier: 

| Time   | Event           |
| ------ | --------------- |
| 4:30pm | Beginner Lesson |
| 5:00pm | Dance Begins    |
| 8:00pm | Dance Ends      |

We'll host these 4th Sunday dances every month in the first half of 2025, with two exceptions:
- **No dance April 27th**, to avoid [NEFFA](https://www.neffa.org/festival-home/)
- **No dance May 25th**, because the hall will be used by [Contact Improv Boston](https://contactimprovboston.com/yearly_events) for their annual May Jam event
## Mask Policy
These new afternoon dances will alternate mask-required and mask-optional per month, starting required in January:

| Date    | Mask Policy |
| -------- | ----------- |
| January 26  | Required    |
| February 23 | Optional    |
| March 23   | Required    |
| June 22    | Optional    |

## Volunteers Needed!
To make this a sustainable change, we will need volunteer support from our community. If you'd like to be more involved with BIDA, check out [our page on getting involved](https://www.bidadance.org/get-involved).
